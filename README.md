# Mayflower Ancestors Gedmatch Kit Interrogator

A simple tool for displaying which kits in the Mayflower Ancestors Project GEDMatch results are associated with which passenger ancestors in the project spreadsheet.

Known issues:

Pages bigger than 100 matches will cause the results page not to load. Google limits the number of times I can query the spreadsheet to 100 requests per second unless I pay them money. I'll try to work out a way to space out the queries or break the data up.

The user interface is awful. Apologies, I want to make sure the basic idea of this page is viable and will stand up to multiple users before I figure out where the buttons should go and how the information can be better presented.
